[Linux Utility]
====================

### A Subset of Utilities Tested with Ratel

We further tested the compatibility offered by Ratel with the Linux built-in binaries on Ubuntu 16.04. These two ***tar.gz*** files comprise ***19+114*** shared-objected binaries, 133 in total, which typically are from the directories ***/bin*** and ***/usr/bin***, respectively. Each utility was performed with the most representative options and inputs, all of which worked correctly in our tests out-of-the-box.
