[Linux Utility](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/)
====================

### A Subset of Utilities Tested with Ratel

We further tested the compatibility offered by **Ratel** with the Linux built-in binaries on Ubuntu 16.04. These two ***tar.gz*** files comprise ***20+118*** shared-objected binaries, ***138*** in total, which typically are from the directories ***/bin*** and ***/usr/bin***, respectively. Each utility was performed with the most representative options and inputs, all of which worked correctly in our tests out-of-the-box. However, also be noted that some of the utilities may fail on individual and less important options due to lack of ***fork*** support in the current version of **Ratel**.
